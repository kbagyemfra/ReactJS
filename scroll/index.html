            Dear brothers and sisters, We are deeply thankful to the Lord for
            all He has done during this pandemic in leading so many saints to
            pray in a daily way for His move, both in this country and
            throughout the whole earth. We believe that cumulatively, such
            prayers signal a renewed entrance of thousands of saints into a life
            of petition and intercession for the fulfillment of His purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ who have personally
            received Him as our Savior. He is the most excellent and enjoyable
            Person. We love Him and endeavor to give Him the first place in all
            things. We rejoice to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus, God’s Son,
            born again of the Father’s divine life, and filled with the Holy
            Spirit. We highly treasure the Holy Bible as God’s revelation of
            Himself and of His eternal purpose. We hold the common faith which
            is revealed in the Bible and is common to all genuine believers. We
            gather together simply as believers of the Lord in the city of Dunn
            Loring, and we receive as our brothers and sisters all who believe
            in Jesus Christ. We are in fellowship with over 2,000 local churches
            worldwide to express the one Body of Christ.

            At this time, we have been led by the Lord, in the fellowship of the
            Body, to discontinue the putting out of daily prayer burdens and
            email reminders after September 26th, the final day of next week. It
            is our earnest hope that the saints who have subscribed to receive
            these prayer burdens would not cease their scheduled times of prayer
            and intercession, both personally and in small groups, and would
            endeavor to continue steadfastly in the weekly prayer meetings of
            the church.
