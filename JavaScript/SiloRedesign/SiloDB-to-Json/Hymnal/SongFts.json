The Triune God flowing in me!\nOh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\nI've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\n\nAs this life flows through me, I'm supplied abundantly.\nHis life nullifies sin!\nPower springs now from within!\nTo be free, overcoming spontaneously.\n\nYet this life though it frees, is not meant for mere victory.\nGod is full of intent and never could flow aimlessly.\nSo this life has a totality, a consummate issue encompassing me.\nLife moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows\nNow I share in this life's destiny.\nOh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\nI've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\n\nWe'll abide mutually, God and man revealed to be\nLamb, Wife, Spirit, and Bride.\nCome! Drink! And riverside,\nGrows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!\n\nSo I've no cause to frown as one who's received this zoe.\nI know life runs its course and triumphs inevitably.\nI'm required just to stay in the flow,\nIf I do the drinking then God gives the growth.\nSo there's joy in my heart, and a spring in my step,\nAnd a smile on my face as I sing,\nOh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!\nI've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!"
