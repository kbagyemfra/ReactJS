              Major credit cards are any cards that belong to one of the big
              four credit card networks: Visa, Mastercard, American Express and
              Discover. That’s what stores mean by “we accept all major credit
              cards.” A major credit card will almost always show the logo of
              its network on the front. In some cases it’ll be on the back. If a
              card doesn’t have such a logo, it’s likely a store card that can
              only be used at a specific retailer.

              Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial
              resale and with a strong priority placed on "speed of service"
              versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science.

              A key reason why people drink coffee is to get their daily dose of
              caffeine. Caffeine is the most consumed psychoactive substance in
              the world. It may help boost your mood and elevate your mental and
              physical performance (1Trusted Source). Inside your body, caffeine
              passes through the gut and into the bloodstream. Eventually, it
              reaches your liver, where it’s broken down into several compounds
              that affect how organs like your brain function (2Trusted Source).
